--------------------------------
If I had to update millions of records I would probably opt to NOT update.
I would more likely do:

CREATE TABLE new_table as select <do the update "here"> from old_table;

> create table new_emp as
select empno, LOWER(ename) ename, JOB,
MGR, HIREDATE, SAL, COMM, DEPTNO
from emp;
=> Table created.

> drop table emp;
=> Table dropped.

> rename new_emp to emp;
=> Table renamed.
