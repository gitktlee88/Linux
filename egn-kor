수없이 헤매였던 환상 속에
In countless wandering fantasies [“fantasies that wandered”이라는 정확한 뜻입니까?]

키보다 높은 꿈은 무뎌지고
My lofty dreams are dulled [이것은 정확한 의미가 아니라고 알지만 정확히 번역하는 것이 너무 어렵습니다.]

철없음으로 얼룩진 나날들
And my days stained with childishness.

시간 속에 묻혀지겠지
Will be buried in the depths of time (That's very good!)

수없이 헤매였던 환상 속에 키보다 높은 꿈은 무뎌지고,
By illusions having been wandered around countlessly, a dream of lofty in a stature will be dulled

철없음으로 얼룩진 나날들(은) 시간(의 흐름) 속에 묻혀지겠지
And the days stained with childshness will be buried in the passage of time

How about this? "시간 속에" into "in times"

A: May i talk to you please? Alone
B: No. Whatever you have to say, you... you can say to both of us.
A: Fine. You can't marry a man you just met.
B: You can...if it's tru love.
A: Anna, what do you know about true love?
B: More than you. All you know is how to shut people out.

---------------------
As thirtinth in line in my own kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. 
I knew I'd have to marry into the throne somewhere...

As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course.
But no one was getting anywhere with her.

But you... You were so desperate for love,
you were willing to marry me, just like that.

I figured, after we married, I'd have to stage a little accident for Elsa.
But then she doomed herself, and you were dumb enough to go after her.

All that's left now is to kill Elsa and bring back summer.
---------------------
I know you'll never forgive me. And i don't blame you.
I wouldn't forgive me either. 
I was ignorant and irresponsible and small-minded...
But predators shouldn't suffer because of my mistakes.
I have to fix this, but i can't do it without you.

Judy, ever wonder how your mom and me got to be so darn happy.
Well, I'll tell ya how - we gave up on our dreams and we settled.
See, that's the beauty of complacency.
If you don't try anything new, you'll never fail.
