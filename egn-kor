이 노래의 노랫말은 시적인 표현이 매우 많습니다.
What am I here to find? 무엇을 찾기 위해 나는 여기에 (있는가?)
Also, where is the dream I tried to catch? 잡으려 했던 꿈은 또 어디에 (있는가?)
  
사랑만으로 채울 수 없었던 삶, Life that I couldn't fill up with only love
잊혀져 간 삶,  Life having been forgotten
삺의 흔적들, The traces of life
사랑만으로 채울 수 없었던, 잊혀져 간 삶의 흔적들
The traces of a forgotten life that I couldn't fill with only love
 
잊다. to forget
잊-히-다 to be forgotten (passive voice)
잊-혀(히어)-지다. to be forgotten (이중 피동, double passive voice)
잊-혀-져 가다. to have been forgotten

수없이 헤매였던 환상 속에
In countless wandering fantasies [“fantasies that wandered”이라는 정확한 뜻입니까?]

키보다 높은 꿈은 무뎌지고
My lofty dreams are dulled [이것은 정확한 의미가 아니라고 알지만 정확히 번역하는 것이 너무 어렵습니다.]

철없음으로 얼룩진 나날들
And my days stained with childishness.

시간 속에 묻혀지겠지
Will be buried in the depths of time (That's very good!)

수없이 헤매였던 환상 속에 키보다 높은 꿈은 무뎌지고,
By illusions having been wandered around countlessly, a dream of lofty in a stature will be dulled

철없음으로 얼룩진 나날들(은) 시간(의 흐름) 속에 묻혀지겠지
And the days stained with childshness will be buried in the passage of time

How about this? "시간 속에" into "in times"

---------------------
As thirtinth in line in my own kingdom, I didn't stand a chance. 
I knew I'd have to marry into the throne somewhere...

As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course.
But no one was getting anywhere with her.

But you... You were so desperate for love,
you were willing to marry me, just like that.

I figured, after we married, I'd have to stage a little accident for Elsa.
But then she doomed herself, and you were dumb enough to go after her.

All that's left now is to kill Elsa and bring back summer.
---------------------
I know you'll never forgive me. And i don't blame you.
I wouldn't forgive me either. 
I was ignorant and irresponsible and small-minded...
But predators shouldn't suffer because of my mistakes.
I have to fix this, but i can't do it without you.

Judy, ever wonder how your mom and me got to be so darn happy.
Well, I'll tell ya how - we gave up on our dreams and we settled.
See, that's the beauty of complacency.
If you don't try anything new, you'll never fail.
