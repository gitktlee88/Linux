If you want to read a file, and write it to another file, doing search/replace as you go, 
- use sed:

sed 's/abc/XYZ/g' <infile >outfile

If you want to edit the file in place 
(as if opening the file in an editor, editing it, then saving it) 
supply instructions to the line editor 'ex'

echo "%s/abc/XYZ/g
w
q
" | ex file

'ex' is like 'vi' without the fullscreen mode. 
You can give it the same commands you would at vi's ':' prompt.
